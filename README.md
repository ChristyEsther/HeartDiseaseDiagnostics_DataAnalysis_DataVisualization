# HeartDiseaseDiagnostics_DataAnalysis_ML Model_Tableau_DataVisualization
This is a comprehensive Data Analysis, Machine Learning Model, Data Visualization work done, focused on heart disease diagnostics (CVD), I harnessed the power of Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries to conduct an in-depth investigation of the dataset. Utilizing Pandas' versatile data manipulation tools and tapping into NumPy's computational capabilities, I meticulously prepared and preprocessed the data for analysis. Employing a combination of statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, I successfully identified crucial factors influencing heart disease risk, culminating in the development of predictive models. Impressively, the Random Forest model exhibited an impressive accuracy of 90%, showcasing its robustness in classifying heart disease cases. Meanwhile, the Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 87%, underlining its effectiveness in this diagnostic context. To communicate these findings effectively, I employed Tableau's visualization prowess, creating dynamic and insightful visualizations that succinctly presented key trends, risk indicators, and model performance metrics. This comprehensive approach not only deepened my understanding of cardiovascular disease dynamics but also paved the way for data-driven decisions that can significantly impact diagnostics and preventive strategies.
